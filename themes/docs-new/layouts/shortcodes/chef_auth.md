All communication between Chef Infra Client or Chef Workstation and the Chef Infra Server occurs through the Chef Infra Server API. The Chef Infra Server API is an authenticated REST API, with all requests requiring authentication and authorization. Most of the time, and especially when using command-line tools, the use of the Chef Infra Server API is transparent to the user.
