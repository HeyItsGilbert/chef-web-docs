# Conclusion

We've presented just a small selection of **lorem ipsum** "*dummy text*"
**generators**, there are many more available.

The placeholder text generator you choose doesn't have to relate to your
actual site in any way. It's an opportunity to release the inner
fantasies or leisure time activities as a way to have a little fun with
your site until you're ready to add in the relevant text for all of your
pages.

Using the text helps you get a better view of your site while it's still
in the design stage so you can correct any flaws that are obvious. You
can change the text you use and also the generator you take it from as
often as you like so have some fun with it.
